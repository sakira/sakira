### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on machine learning, deep learning, probabilistic graphical modeling, Bayesian filtering and smoothing, optimal control, ~~quantum machine learning ~~
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on natural language processing, deep learning
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with model uncertainty
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about machine learning
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: sakira.hassan@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: Never use ML or DL if you can solve the problem otherwise. 

Reading groups/Seminars that I am following:
- <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/dce-reading-group"> Data-Centric Engineering Reading Group </a> @ The Alan Turing Institute, London UK
- <a href="https://fcai.fi/machine-learning-coffee-seminar"> Machine Learning Coffee Seminar </a> @ Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence (FCAI)
- <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~dimitrib/RLbook.html"> Reinforcement Learning and Optimal Control </a> Dimitri Bertsekas' Lectures @ Arizona State University
- <a href="https://www.imsi.institute/programs/"> Workshops related to Optimal control </a> @  Institute for Mathematical and Statistical Innovation (IMSI) 
- <a href="https://awjuliani.medium.com/"> A nice personal blog of Juliani on RL</a>
